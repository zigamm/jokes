                      They went to his car and started kissing hotly.<br>
                      The boy gently hinted to her, "Would you go to the back seats now?"<br>
                      The blonde angrily replied, "NO!"<br>
                      The boy comes to terms with this and so they continue kissing, so the boy reaches under her shirt and starts stroking her breasts.<br>
                      As things got even hotter, the boy hinted to her again, "Wouldn't you really go to the back seats?"<br>
                      And the blonde this time even more angrily "No, no way!"<br>
                      Now the boy starts caressing her between her legs and because he can't take it anymore, he asks her the same question again ...<br>
                      The blonde gets completely upset and says to him, "No, last time I say NO to you and don't ask me that anymore!"<br>
                      Now the boy is already hooked and so he asks her: "What the hell is wrong with you, why don't you want that ???"<br>
                      
                      The blonde replies, "I don't want to go to the back seats because I'll be there alone, and I'd like to stay here with you ..."</p>
